Stratus is an iOS native mobile application that interacts with Appareo's Stratus 2 device. The repo represents 
all classes, media, and files needed to run the Stratus application as well documents used to specify project requirements. 

To run our application you will need the Stratus 2 device or Stratus Emulator, and an iOS device or iOS Emulator. 
Build the project with Xcode and run on the iOS device or emulator. Then connect to the Stratus 2 device or emulator.
